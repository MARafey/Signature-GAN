This script demonstrates a complete pipeline for generating fake hand signature images using both a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved:

### Data Loading and Augmentation:
- **SignatureDataset**: A custom `Dataset` class to load and preprocess signature images from different class folders.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied transformations, such as resizing and random affine transformations (rotation, translation, scaling), to diversify the dataset and improve model robustness.

### Model Architectures:
1. **VAE**:
   - **Encoder**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) compresses the input into a latent space.
   - **Latent Space**: The latent vector is sampled using the reparameterization trick (sampling from a Gaussian distribution defined by `mu` and `logvar`).
   - **Decoder**: A transposed CNN reconstructs the image from the latent vector.

2. **GAN**:
   - **Generator**: Converts random noise from the latent space into signature-like images using transposed convolution layers.
   - **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake signatures using CNN layers, outputting a probability score.

### Training Process:
- **VAE Training**: The VAE minimizes a combination of reconstruction loss (BCE) and a regularization term (KL divergence) to balance reconstruction quality and smoothness in the latent space.
- **GAN Training**: Alternates between training the Discriminator and the Generator. The Discriminator learns to classify real vs. fake images, while the Generator learns to produce realistic images by fooling the Discriminator.

### Results:
- **Loss Values**: The VAE's reconstruction loss decreases steadily over the epochs, and the GAN's discriminator and generator losses indicate the dynamic between the two networks stabilizing over time.
- **Signature Generation**: New samples are generated using both the VAE and GAN, and saved as images for evaluation.

### Next Steps:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The learning rates, latent dimensions, and number of epochs can be fine-tuned to optimize performance.
2. **Evaluation**: Consider adding metrics to quantitatively evaluate the generated samples, such as Inception Score (IS) or Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).
3. **Visual Inspection**: The generated signatures should be visually inspected to ensure they resemble authentic signatures.
